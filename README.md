// MINESWEEPER HOW TO PLAY

To play Minesweeper, we will create instances of MineSweeperGame in command line.

For example:
In the command line, navigate to the lib directory and run 'node'
Run '.load game.js' to load the contents of this file.
Then create a Game instance and run commands like so:
let game = new Game(3, 3, 3);
game.playMove(0, 1);
game.playMove(1, 2);
When done run '.exit'
